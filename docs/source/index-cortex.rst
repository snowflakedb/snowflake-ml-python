Snowflake Cortex APIs in ``snowflake-ml-python``
===========================================================

These APIs provide access to Snowflake Cortex features from Python.

.. note::

    Functions in this module are also available through "CamelCase" names (for example, ``ClassifyText`` is the same as
    ``classify_text``). These names are deprecated as of ``snowflake-ml-python`` version 1.7.3, and will be removed in
    a future release. Use the "snake_case" names shown here.
