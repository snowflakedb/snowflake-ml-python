Distributed Modeling Classes
****************************

When using `Container Runtime for ML <https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-on-spcs>`_
in a `Snowflake Notebook <https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks>`_, a set of distributed
modeling classes is available to train selected types of models on large datasets using the full resources of a
Snowpark Container Services (SPCS) `compute pool <https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/services/manage-compute-pools>`_.

The following model types are supported:

- :ref:`XGBoost <label-distributors_xgboost>`

``snowflake.ml.modeling.distributors.pytorch.PyTorchScalingConfig``

    Scaling configuration for training PyTorch models.

    This class defines the scaling configuration for a PyTorch training job,
    including the number of nodes, the number of workers per node, and the
    resource requirements for each worker.

    Attributes:

        num_nodes (int): The number of nodes to use for training.

        num_workers_per_node (int): The number of workers to use per node.

        resource_requirements_per_worker (WorkerResourceConfig): The resource requirements
        for each worker, such as the number of CPUs and GPUs.

``snowflake.ml.modeling.distributors.pytorch.WorkerResourceConfig``

    Resources requirements per worker.

    This class defines the resource requirements for each worker in a distributed
    training job, specifying the number of CPU and GPU resources to allocate.

    Attributes:

        num_cpus (int): The number of CPU cores to reserve for each worker.

        num_gpus (int): The number of GPUs to reserve for each worker.
        Default is 0, indicating no GPUs are reserved.

``snowflake.ml.modeling.distributors.pytorch.Context``

    Context for setting up the PyTorch distributed environment for training scripts.

    Context defines the necessary methods to manage and retrieve information
    about the distributed training environment, including worker and node ranks,
    world size, and backend configurations.

    Definitions:

        Node: A physical instance or a container.

        Worker: A worker process in the context of distributed training.

        WorkerGroup: The set of workers that execute the same function (e.g., trainers).

        LocalWorkerGroup: A subset of the workers in the worker group running on the same node.

        RANK: The rank of the worker within a worker group.

        WORLD_SIZE: The total number of workers in a worker group.

        LOCAL_RANK: The rank of the worker within a local worker group.

        LOCAL_WORLD_SIZE: The size of the local worker group.
        rdzv_id: An ID that uniquely identifies the worker group for a job. This ID is used by each node to join as
            a member of a particular worker group.

        rdzv_backend: The backend of the rendezvous (e.g., c10d). This is typically a strongly consistent
            key-value store.

        rdzv_endpoint: The rendezvous backend endpoint; usually in the form <host>:<port>.

    Methods:

    ``get_world_size(self) -> int``
        Return the number of workers (or processes) participating in the job.

        For example, if training is running on 2 nodes (servers) each with 4 GPUs,
        then the world size is 8 (2 nodes * 4 GPUs per node). Usually, each GPU corresponds
        to a training process.

    ``get_rank(self) -> int``
        Return the rank of the current process across all processes.

        Rank is the unique ID given to a process to identify it uniquely across the world.
        It should be a number between 0 and world_size - 1.

        Some frameworks also call it world_rank, to distinguish it from local_rank.
        For example, if training is running on 2 nodes (servers) each with 4 GPUs,
        then the ranks will be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], i.e., from 0 to world_size - 1.

    ``get_local_rank(self) -> int``
        Return the local rank for the current worker.

        Local rank is a unique local ID for a worker (or process) running on the current node.

        For example, if training is running on 2 nodes (servers) each with 4 GPUs, then
        local rank for workers(or processes) running on node 0 will be [0, 1, 2, 3] and
        similarly four workers(or processes) running on node 1 will have local_rank [0, 1, 2, 3].

    ``get_local_world_size(self) -> int``
        Return the number of workers running in the current node.

        For example, if training is running on 2 nodes (servers) each with 4 GPUs,
        then local_world_size will be 4 for all processes on both nodes.

    ``get_node_rank(self)``
        Return the rank of the current node across all nodes.

        Node rank is a unique ID given to each node to identify it uniquely across all nodes
        in the world.

        For example, if training is running on 2 nodes (servers) each with 4 GPUs,
        then node ranks will be [0, 1] respectively.

    ``get_master_addr(self) -> str``
        Return IP address of the master node.

        This is typically the address of the node with node_rank 0.

    ``def get_master_port(self) -> int``
        Return port on master_addr that hosts the rendezvous server.

    ``get_default_backend(self) -> str``
        Return default backend selected by MCE.

    ``get_supported_backends(self) -> List[str]``
        Return list of supported backends by MCE.

    ``get_hyper_params(self) -> Optional[Dict[str, str]]``
        Return hyperparameter map provided to trainer.run(...) method.

    ``get_dataset_map(self) -> Optional[Dict[str, Type[DataConnector]]]``
        Return dataset map provided to trainer.run(...) method.
