# Add requirements information here and use `bazel run --config=pre_build //bazel/requirements:sync_requirements`
# to generate all other requirements files.
# Please provide the following fields when adding a new record:
# # Package Name Fields

# `name`: The name of the package. Set this if the package is available with the same name and is required in both `PyPI`
# and `conda`.

# `name_pypi`: The name of the package in `PyPI`. Set this only to indicate that it is available in `PyPI` only. You can
# also set this along with `name_conda` if the package has different names in `PyPI` and `conda`.

# `name_conda`: The name of the package in `conda`. Set this only to indicate that it is available in `conda` only. You
# can also set this along with `name_pypi` if the package has different names in `PyPI` and `conda`.

# (At least one of these three fields should be set.)

# # Development Version Fields

# `dev_version`: The version of the package to be pinned in the dev environment. Set this if the package is available
# with the same version and is required in both `PyPI` and conda.

# `dev_version_pypi`: The version from `PyPI` to be pinned in the dev environment. Set this only to indicate that it is
# available in `PyPI` only. You can also set this along with `dev_version_conda` if the package has different versions in
# `PyPI` and `conda`.

# `dev_version_conda`: The version from `conda` to be pinned in the dev environment. Set this only to indicate that it is
# available in `conda` only. You can also set this along with `dev_version_pypi` if the package has different versions in
# `PyPI` and `conda`.

# (At least one of these three fields should be set.)

# `require_gpu`: Set this to true if the package is only a requirement for the environment with GPUs.

# # Snowflake Anaconda Channel

# `from_channel`: Set this if the package is not available in the Snowflake Anaconda Channel
# (https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake).

# # Version Requirements Fields (for `snowflake-ml-python` release)

# `version_requirements`: The version requirements specifiers when this requirement is a dependency of the
# `snowflake-ml-python` release. Set this if the package is available with the same name and required in both `PyPI` and
# `conda`.

# `version_requirements_pypi`: The version requirements specifiers when this requirement is a dependency of the
#`snowflake-ml-python` release via `PyPI`. Set this only to indicate that it is required by the `PyPI` release only. You
# can also set this along with `version_requirements_conda` if the package has different versions in `PyPI` and `conda`.

# `version_requirements_conda`: The version requirements specifiers when this requirement is a dependency of the
# `snowflake-ml-python` release via `conda`. Set this only to indicate that it is required by the `conda` release only.
# You can also set this along with `version_requirements_pypi` if the package has different versions in `PyPI` and `conda`.

# (At least one of these three fields must be set to indicate that this package is a dependency of the release. If you
# don't want to constrain the version, set the field to an empty string.)

# # Extras Tags and Tags

# `requirements_extra_tags`: Set this to indicate that the package is an extras dependency of `snowflake-ml-python`.
# This requirement will be added to all extras tags specified here, and an `all` extras tag will be auto-generated to include
# all extras requirements. All extras requirements will be labeled as `run_constrained` in conda's meta.yaml.

# `tags`: Set tags to filter some of the requirements in specific cases. The current valid tags include:
#   - `deployment_core`: Used by model deployment to indicate dependencies required to execute model deployment code
#   on the server-side. (Obsolete)
#   - `model_packaging`: Used by model packaging and deployment to indicate the core requirements to save and load the
#   model.
#   - `udf_inference`: Used by model packaging and deployment to indicate the requirements to run inference in UDF.
#   - `spcs_inference`: Used by model packaging and deployment to indicate the requirements to run inference in SPCS.
#   - `build_essential`: Used to indicate the packages composing the build environment.
